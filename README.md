# Hack Recursive Factorial Stack Overflow

This repository demonstrates a common error in Hack: a stack overflow resulting from unbounded recursion in a factorial function. The original `bug.hack` file contains a recursive implementation that fails for large inputs.  The `bugSolution.hack` provides an iterative solution that avoids the stack overflow.
